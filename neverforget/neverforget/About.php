			<h3>About Us</h3>
			<p> If you are anything like us, you are surprised every year when it's time to celebrate someones birthday.
				Usualy followed by "wow has it been a year already?" Eventually, we grew tired of forgetting birthdays, anniversaries,
				heck even Christmas and vowed that we would <strong>Never Forget</strong> ever again.</p>
				<p>Of course we are not by any means a human calendar nor an elephant. So rather than trying to memorize dates,
				we came up with an app instead that remembers dates for you and even allows you to choose what gifts you would want to send. 
				It's very simple. Choose the dates you are supposed to remember, select the types of gifts you want to send and just like that,
				you will <strong>Never Forget</strong> and important date ever again!</p>
				<p>This is perfect for planning a yearly budget. Or if you're a true romantic, plan just because gifts throughout the year
				(that's free game playa).</p>
