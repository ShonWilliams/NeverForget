# NeverForget
Personal project / business idea 

Have you ever forgot a loved ones birthday ? 
Maybe your anniversarry or valentine's day came up sooner than expected. How about Mothers day? Fathers day?

Never Forget allows you to plan ahead to eliminate the risk of forgetting these special events. 

Simply select what kind of membership works for you, set what dates, gifts and for who throughout the year and then... forget. Leave the rest to us. 

This idea has come from my own forgetfulness in the past. 

Now the older I get the more dates I have to remember (for just my wife it's her birthday, dating anniversary, engagment anniversary, wedding anniversary, and valentines day!)

Throw in kids, parents and siblings this easily increases exponentially. 

Let us remmeber for you join Never Forget today!
